Review:
Overall, I thought the code examples were very informative and the brick-by-brick nature of the examples
was great. As someone who dabbles in numerical PDE approximation, the Navier-Stokes equations I tended 
to avoid due to the system of differential equations however, this course presents the equations in a friendly way.

I feel like the codebase was degraded in quality especially around steps 11 and 12. I'm not sure if this 
was present during student's assesment, so it has to be barebones. Step 12 especially I ended up rewriting
the whole thing to be more functional. 

Mainly, I do implicit schemes and it was a shame to not see those schemes in the practical course. However,
I have seen from the slides that other schemes should be included in the later lectures, so those lectures 
will be highly valuable for my studies. 

Overall, I am extremely grateful to Dr. Lorena Barba for publishing the lectures / slides / examples online
for free. Thank you.
